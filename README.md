# Car Dashboard Analysis
# Hyundai Elantra

The Hyundai Elantra is a economy class sedan that perfectly a single person or small family. It's small, gets great gas mileage, and has all of the essentials.

You can tell right away that the interface is really clean and not incredibly cluttered. This is partially due to a great layout and also partially due to the fact that the Hyundai Elantra, being an economy class car, doesn't have all the bells and whistles.

Upon closer inspection it's easy to see that you may have some trouble reading this dashboard. What do the lights mean? When I was 16 and had just gotten this car, my low tire pressure light came on and I had no clue what it meant. I had to look at the user manual because the light doesn't really look like a low tire to me, with it just looking like an exclamation mark between two parentheses (!). While I can see it now, it's not what came to mind at first. Overall though, I think that the layout is simple and clean enough that it would be easy to learn, as was my experience. One of my favorite things is how the fuel gauge is actually a digital bar which is very intuitive to read. Just like water fills up a cup, the gas level will change appropriately on the vertical fuel gauge.

Pros: Simple layout, not too cluttered, gas gauge is very intuitive, aethetically pleasing
Cons: Symbols aren't always easy to figure out, but can be remedied quickly by glancing at the user manual or a google search

# Toyota FJ Cruiser

The Toyota FJ Cruiser is a utlity vehicle commonly used on rugged terrain, like for rock climbing. It's very versatile, sturdy, and powerful.

Just like it's exterior, the interior is also rugged and simple. It has a few cool added features, like the instrument cluster on the center dash that has a compass, thermometer, and inclinometer.

I think this dashboard is probably as simple as it can be for a car today. I genuinely don't have any doubts about where or what things are, and it displays everything it needs to. However, the design is not as aesthetically appealing.

Pros: Simple, has everything you need, no guessing required
Cons: Not very appealing design, though it corresponds to the ruggedness of the rest of the vehicle
