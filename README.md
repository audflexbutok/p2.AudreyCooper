# Car Dashboard Analysis
# Hyundai Elantra
![image](/images/HyundaiElantra.jpg)
The Hyundai Elantra is a economy class sedan that perfectly a single person or small family. It's small, gets great gas mileage, and has all of the essentials.

You can tell right away that the interface is really clean and not incredibly cluttered. This is partially due to a great layout and also partially due to the fact that the Hyundai Elantra, being an economy class car, doesn't have all the bells and whistles.

This dashboard is very simple and clean. It utilizes the standard symbols for low tire pressure, oil, check engine, etc. The benefit of this is that it's easy to see when there's a problem and identify it. I particularly like how the gas level indicator is a vertical bar that increases and decreases with how much gas the car has. It's like a glass of water, when the cup is full, the bar is full. I find that very intuitive and visually pleasing. I also like how the information is visually split up so that everything isn't so cluttered on the dashboard. This reduces the time it takes me to find something that I need, especially if I need to see it while I'm driving.

Pros: Very clean, maximizes simplicity, great use of intuitive displays
Cons: Perhaps too simple for some 

# Toyota FJ Cruiser

The Toyota FJ Cruiser is a utlity vehicle commonly used on rugged terrain, like for rock climbing. It's very versatile, sturdy, and powerful.

Just like it's exterior, the interior is also rugged and simple. It has a few cool added features, like the instrument cluster on the center dash that has a compass, thermometer, and inclinometer.

I think this dashboard is probably as simple as it can be for a car today. I genuinely don't have any doubts about where or what things are, and it displays everything it needs to. However, I personally don't think the design is as visually appealing because it takes an older style approach.

Pros: Simple, has everything you need, no guessing required
Cons: Not very appealing design, though it corresponds to the ruggedness of the rest of the vehicle

# Subaru Outback

The Subaru Outback is a good "Mom" car. It's got plenty of room, and a great dash display with an infotainment center/GPS.

At first glance, I think that this setup doesn't look very hard to use. It's not cluttered, so everything is spaced out enough to where labels are adequately sized and easy to read. It's also very visually appealing.

The speedometer is large enough, and easy to read. However, I don't like that the gas indicator is very small and not as intuitive to read. The screen in the middle is difficult to read at first. It has an instantaneous gas milage indicator that constantly changes with respect to the driver's current actions, rather than just the average gas mileage indicator that takes the avergage of the instantaneous gas mileage. I think the reminder of "Keep Eyes on Road" is a bit stupid since there is a legitimate reason to be looking at the dashboard like for checking your speed, RPMs, or the fuel level. However, it's understandable in today's climate since there are many people that need reminders like this. On the bottom of the screen, the left will show what gear your car is in, like drive, reverse, neutral, etc. In the middle, it shows what trip it's on, such as trip A or trip B. On the right, the "eye" symbol indicates that the "eyesight" is on, which is a device that tells you when your car goes outside the lane boundaries, aids in parking, and can tell the distance of the car in front of you. Under that is presumably the milage count for the trip.

Pros: good features, not too cluttered with information
Cons: not as easy to learn how to read the information, reading the fuel gauge is not intituive.
# Tesla Model S

The Tesla Model S is considered a luxury battery powered car. It has a sleek design, and is most likely tailored to fit single people or small families that don't need to drive incredibly long distances.

The dashboard, while sleek, does look a bit complicated at first. I worry about the tablet in the middle, which is very large and may cause issues with glare or too much information on the screen that would be disorienting.

When I looked closer at the tablet in the middle, it seems efficient in that it's just a touch screen and you don't have to press certain buttons that are programmed to control it like other cars. It's large, so you can see details about the map and navigation easier. It's also neat that there is a great music system at the bottom, but it looks a bit too cluttered for me while I'm driving. I was able to zoom into the image to see that the dashboard displays the current speed, along with what gear the car is in. I'm not sure what the graph is, but it seems that there is a W on the right side of the graph so maybe it has something to do with wattage. Upon further research, it seems that the Tesla Model S will update the dashboard with more information such as when a door is opened, and it can also be customized by the user.

Pros: can be customized by user, sleek and visually appealing interface, reasonably simple
Cons: large tablet and too much information can be disorienting


# Honda Clarity Fuel Cell

The Honda Clarify Fuel Cell is Honda's take on a hydrogen fuel vehicle. It's supposed to be very efficient and luxurious, similar to the Tesla.

I do enjoy how clean the space looks, but at first I think there is a lot of buttons cluttered on the steering wheel. The buttons below the touch screen aren't a big deal as it's most likely just the temperature for the front air vents, which are easy to figure out. I'm not sure what the deal with the center console is.

![image](/images/HondaFuelCellDashboard2.jpg)

This interface looks very standard and not too exciting compared to other vehicles with similar setups. I am not a huge fan of touch screens that have many buttons on the side to control them, and the volume button on the side annoys me already. The day/night mode button on the bottom left looks handy though. I can also see that this car features a vertical fuel indicator similar to the Hyundai Elantra, which I like.

Pros: Relatively clean interface, it's similar to most other cars like this so it wouldn't be too hard to figure out
Cons: annoying volume controls, cluttered steering wheel buttons

# Most Common Car Dashboard Features

Most commonly, the following features are found on a car dashboard: speedometer, tachometer, odometer, engine coolant temperature gauge, fuel gauge, turn indicators, gearshift position indicator, seltbelt warning light, parking-brake warning light, check engine light, low tire pressure indicator, cruise control indicator, oil indicator, gas milage indicator.

The most commonly used features from these are the speedometer and the fuel gauge. If your car is manual, you will look at the dashboard more to check the gear that the car is in. After this, I think the engine coolant temperature gauge, odometer, tachometer, cruise control indicator, and turn indicators are the next most commonly used features. Although the seatbelt warning light and check engine light are important, they are used less often and many times a car will make noise whenever one of these lights come on.

Common mistakes with the current designs are visually splitting up the information too much. I think it's helpful when all the indicator lights are in the same general area, or just to group up information/buttons by area in the first place. Another mistake is overcluttering of information. If it's too cluttered you will not be able to see the information as easily, and it will take your brain longer to "parse" the info. Also, when cars use nonstandard indicator lights it might be difficult to figure out what the issue is although that is easily fixed by looking at the user manual.
